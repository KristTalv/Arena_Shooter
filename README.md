# Arena_Shooter
School group project. Using Unity 2D and C#

I wrote all the scripts attached to Player game object, UI and Scene Manager. My code partner did the Enemy scripts. I also did all the particle effects. Art is produced by other team members.
The scripts attached to Playr are: 
- AimToShoot
- Bullet
- FollowMouse
- FollowPlayer
- HpManager
- ParticleDestroy
- PlayerController
- SceneManager
- Shooting
- UiButtons
